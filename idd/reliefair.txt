      \required-field
      \type real
      \units kg/s
      \minimum> 0
      \note Enter the air mass flow coefficient at the conditions defined
      \note in the Reference Crack Conditions object.
      \note Defined at 1 Pa pressure difference. Enter the coefficient used in the following
      \note equation:
      \note Mass Flow Rate = Air Mass Flow Coefficient * (dP)^Air Mass Flow Exponent.
      \note Used only when no outdoor air flow rate.
  N2, \field Air Mass Flow Exponent When No Outdoor Air Flow
      \units dimensionless
      \type real
      \minimum 0.5
      \maximum 1.0
      \default 0.65
      \note Enter the exponent used in the following equation:
      \note Mass Flow Rate = Air Mass Flow Coefficient * (dP)^Air Mass Flow Exponent.
      \note Used only when no outdoor air flow rate.
